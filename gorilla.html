                    <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                    <p>Gorillas are the largest primates on Earth, but they are mostly calm and gentle. Despite their size, they are shy and peaceful, not aggressive unless threatened.<br>Gorillas share about 98% of their DNA with humans. They laugh when tickled, grieve when a loved one dies, and even use tools like sticks or rocks. Gorillas are up to 10 times stronger than the average human. But they mostly use their strength for climbing, foraging, or defending their troop.</p>
                    <p>Gorillas use grunts, hoots, roars, and even belches to talk to each other! A deep "belch" sound means, “Everything's okay.” <br>A Group of Gorillas Is Called a “troop” or “band”. A troop usually has one dominant male (a silverback), several females, and their young. Adult male gorillas are called silverbacks because of the silver hair that grows on their back. They are strong protectors and wise leaders of their group.<br>Gorilla babies weigh only about 4 pounds (1.8 kg) at birth. They love to climb, wrestle, and swing - just like human toddlers!</p>
                    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                    <p>You will find the gorilla cage at GO12.</p>
