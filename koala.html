                    <h3>KOALA</h3>
                    <p><h4>Amazing Koala Facts:</h4>Koalas are often called “koala bears,” but they're not bears — they're marsupials! That means they carry their babies in a pouch, just like kangaroos.<br>They sleep up to 18-22 hours a day! Why? Because their food (eucalyptus leaves) is low in energy and takes a long time to digest.You'll only find wild koalas in Australia, mainly in eucalyptus forests along the east coast. </p>
                    <p>Koalas have strong arms, curved claws, and rough pads on their hands to help them climb and grip trees. They spend almost all their time in trees - even sleeping there!<br>Koalas have fingerprints that look just like humans' - even under a microscope!In fact, their prints can confuse crime scene investigations.<br>A baby koala, called a joey, is born the size of a jellybean - about 2 cm long!<br>Male koalas make deep, bellowing calls to attract mates - surprisingly loud for such a small animal!</p>
                    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                    <p>You will find the koalas next to the giraffe enclosure.</p>
