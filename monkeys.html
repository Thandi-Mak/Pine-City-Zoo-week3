                    <h3>DUSKY LEAF MONKEYS</h3>
                    <p> The dusky leaf monkey (also known as the dusky langur or Trachypithecus obscurus) is a fascinating and adorable primate. <span class="highlight">Here's an amazing fact that stands out:<br></span>They're Born Bright Orange! Dusky leaf monkey babies are born with bright orange or golden fur, which is a huge contrast to the adults' soft gray-black coats. Over the next few months, the baby's fur slowly fades to gray, matching the adults in the troop.Scientists believe this bright color helps adults spot and care for the baby more easily — it's nature's way of saying, "Look after me!"</p>
                    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                    <p>You will find the monkeys at the monkey cage near the Monkey Trail.</p>
