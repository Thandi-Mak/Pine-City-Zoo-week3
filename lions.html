                    <h3>LIONS</h3>
                    <p><h4>The Kings of the Savanna</h4><br>Lions are symbols of strength, courage, and royalty in many cultures around the world. They're known as the <span class="highlight">"King of Beasts"</span> for good reason!</p>
                    <p>Unlike other big cats, lions live in groups called prides. A pride can have up to 30 lions, with moms, cubs, and a few males working together like a team. Female lions <span class="highlight">(lionesses)</span> do most of the hunting for the pride - they're faster and more agile. Lions use teamwork to hunt large prey like zebras, wildebeest, and even buffalo. They surround and ambush their targets. A true group strategy! The males often protect the pride and join in at mealtime. Lions rest or sleep up to 20 hours a day! They're most active at dawn and dusk, that's when they hunt and patrol. <br>Male lions grow thick manes around their necks to impress females and intimidate rivals. A darker, fuller mane usually means a stronger and healthier lion. They have the loudest Roar in the Animal Kingdom. A lion's roar can be heard from 8 kilometers away! Roaring helps them communicate, warn rivals, and mark territory.<br>Lion cubs are born with faint spots that help camouflage them in the grass. The spots usually fade as they grow older.</p>
                    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                    <p>You will find the lions at the Northern Frontier</p>
